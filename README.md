# Coeluso-Website

DEMO: https://vuzeta.github.io/Coeluso-Website/

The Ceoluso-Website project was taken from a template at symu.co. The project was coded from a PSD file to HTML. In the project were used technologies: Webpack, npm, Sass, JavaScript. The main reason for creating this website was to get to know the Webpack bundler from scratch. In the project I also learned what Babel.js is and how to use it in projects.

Technology Stack : HTML, CSS, Scss, Javascript, Webpack
