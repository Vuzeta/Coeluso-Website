# Coeluso-Website

### Description 

Ceoluso-Website project was taken from a free template on symu.co.
Cut the template, prepare the markers and place the elements on the page.
Creating this website was aimed at getting to know the Webpack package from scratch.
In the project I also learned what Babel.js is and how to use it in projects.
